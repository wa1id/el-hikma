## Commit guidelines

Always have descriptive commits. Every commit must be prefixed with one of the following:

- **feat:** A new feature
- **fix:** A bug fix
- **refactor:** A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **chore:** Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- **perf:** A code change that improves performance
- **test:** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build:** Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **ci:** Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples:\*\* CircleCi, SauceLabs)
- **docs:** Documentation only changes

Example commit would be `git commit -m "feat: add new Hero component"`
